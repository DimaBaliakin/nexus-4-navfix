# Nexus 4 navigation buttons fix

**Build for Android 5.1.1 (LMY47V) now available!**

Big appreciation for RavanH for testing, so he confirmed that fix as working.

# IMPORTANT NOTICE

My phone is irrecoverably broken and I have no device to test the fix. I will try to provide updates on a infrequent basis but with **NO WARRANTY AT ALL** since I can't even confirm that anything works. Please take in account that any releases later than 5.1.0 is blind-crafted.

I'm really sorry to freeze this little project, but would be happy if my finding (patch) will be applied for custom ROMs someday. I want to say **HUGE THANKS** for everyone in this big community for your feedback.

If you would like to appreciate, post something in this [Thread](https://github.com/gkraynov/nexus-4-navfix/issues/3). Small donation is appreciated as well, e-mail me [github@gkraynov.com](mailto:github@gkraynov.com) to ask my PayPal ID.
