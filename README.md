# Nexus 4 navigation buttons fix

# IMPORTANT NOTICE

I'm desperate due to impossibily of providing updates for this issue. My phone is finally dead and I have no device to test the fix.

What is your options?

1. Promote this [Patch](https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/147266) into CyanogenMod or your favorite ROM vendor. Google has already answered me that this patch is not suitable for AOSP upstream. Sad enough.
2. Use Android 5.1.0 since there is prebuilt available.
3. Buy another phone.

I'm really sorry to stop this little project, but would be happy if my finding (patch) will be applied for custom ROMs someday. I want to say **HUGE THANKS** for everyone in this big community for your feedback and specially for RavanH whos made great tutorial helping to carry out the thing by non-tech users!

If you would like to appreciate, post something in this [Thread](https://github.com/gkraynov/nexus-4-navfix/issues/3). Small donation is appreciated as well, e-mail me [github@gkraynov.com](mailto:github@gkraynov.com) to ask my PayPal ID.

## Prebuilts ##

1. LMY47O (Android 5.1.0)
2. LRX22C (Android 5.0.1)
3. LRX21T (Android 5.0)

See [Releases](https://github.com/gkraynov/nexus-4-navfix/releases) to download `UPDATE.zip`. Verify your build number carefully! Wrong builds will not work.
